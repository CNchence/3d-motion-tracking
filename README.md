## Prerequisites

Ensure you have following installed:

  - [x] [gcc](https://gcc.gnu.org/) with C++11 support.
  - [x] [OpenCV 3.x](http://opencv.org/downloads.html) **with contribution package**
  - [x] A webcamera !


## Compile and run

As simple as:

```
$ make
$ bin/track
```

The tracking program runs forever. Tab `Ctrl + C` to terminate.


## Disclaimer

The build is configured to perfectly fit on MacOS (g++ as a gcc compiler). 
Your mileage may vary if you are compiling the code on a different OS.
